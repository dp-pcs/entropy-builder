# memory/README.md — How beads work here

> This folder is the agent's persistent task graph. It uses either **real Beads** (`bd`, Steve Yegge's Dolt-backed CLI) if detected at install time, or **bd-lite** (a markdown fallback) otherwise. Both expose the same workflow: `bd ready` / `bd update --claim` / `bd close --reason "..."`.

## Why beads

LLMs silently skip steps under load. A bead graph makes "done" atomic and dependency-ordered. Closing requires evidence.

Two sources shaped this:
- **The tool** — [Beads by Steve Yegge](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads). Original Go CLI, Dolt-backed, what `bd-lite` emulates. Announcement: [steve-yegge.medium.com/introducing-beads-a-coding-agent-memory-system](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/introducing-beads-a-coding-agent-memory-system-637d7d92514a).
- **The methodology** — "How to Fix Your AI Agents Skipping Steps" (Trilogy AI COE) popularized using Beads for agent orchestration.

## Files

- `BEADS.md` — the ledger (human-readable + grep-friendly)
- `PROMPTS.md` — verbatim log of human instructions
- `HANDOFF.md` — written at end of each session for the next one
- `BACKUPS/` — rotating backups of memory files (created as needed)
- `bd-lite.sh` — CLI helper (present only when real Beads is not active)

## Commands

All run from `.agent/memory/`.

```bash
./bd-lite.sh create "Task subject" --priority P1 --blocked-by B0003
./bd-lite.sh ready                     # list unblocked pending beads
./bd-lite.sh claim B0007               # mark as in_progress, set claimed_by
./bd-lite.sh close B0007 --reason "Dev server on :3000, test_login.py passes"
./bd-lite.sh block B0007 --reason "BLOCKED: CLIENT_ID missing from .env.example"
./bd-lite.sh list                      # show everything
./bd-lite.sh list --status in_progress
```

## Rules (for the agent — non-negotiable)

1. **Never close without a reason.** The `--reason` string is proof of work. "done" is not acceptable.
2. **Be specific.** Include filenames, ports, counts, test names, screenshots. "fixed bug" is not specific.
3. **Blocked is valid.** If stuck, `block` the bead with a specific blocker. Don't fake completion.
4. **Never edit BEADS.md by hand.** Use the CLI. Hand-edits break the append-only discipline.
5. **Check `ready` before claiming.** Dependencies matter.
6. **One in-progress bead per agent.** Don't claim a second until the first is closed or blocked.

## Upgrading to real Beads (Steve Yegge's tool)

The agentize installer auto-detects real Beads: if `bd` is on PATH when you run
`npx youragent`, it skips bd-lite and runs `bd init --stealth --skip-agents` instead.

**To install bd:** `brew install beads`

**To upgrade an existing bd-lite install:**
1. Install bd: `brew install beads`
2. Re-run: `BEADS_MODE=real npx youragent`
3. Migrate existing beads manually or with a one-shot script:
   ```bash
   # For each open row in BEADS.md (real bd uses lowercase p0/p1/p2):
   bd create "<subject>" --priority p1
   ```

**Override flags:**
- Force real Beads even if auto-detect fails: `BEADS_MODE=real npx youragent`
- Force bd-lite even when bd is installed: `BEADS_MODE=lite npx youragent`

## Session handoff

End of session: update `HANDOFF.md` with what's in flight, what's next, what's blocked. Next session reads it first.
